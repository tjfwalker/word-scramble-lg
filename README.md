## Description

Make a small Scrabble type game for a single-page web app.

This game would be made of three words. You may style these in any way that you would like on the page.

The program needs to scramble the three words, then the end user would have to unscramble the three words.

If they are not successful, then they have to try again. They should have unlimited tries.

Hint: think about arrays, if else statements. Code would be HTML/CSS/Javascript_

## Context

This goal is important since we need to go ahead and continue our use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript!

Make sure to look at templates if you need to, but you should create the code from scratch.

## Specifications

- [ ] Code can be viewed as a web page.
- [ ] There are three words in the program that randomly scramble on page refresh.
- [ ] User is prompted for an answer.
- [ ] User is alerted of game results.
- [ ] Basic CSS styling is used.

### Required

_Do not remove these specs - they are required for all goals_.

- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].
